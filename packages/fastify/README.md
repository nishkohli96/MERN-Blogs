# fastify server

-   There is a different Apollo Pkg for fastify called      
    ```apollo-server-fastify```. Hence the implemenation is slightly different from the express version.
-   As per [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63072227/apollo-graphql-with-fastify), latest version 3.9 of fastify has not been 
    configured to use ```apollo-server-fastify```. Hence using v2.10.0 for the 
    demo.
